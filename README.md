### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Deepak, a Research Fellow at MSR India working in the Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence Group.

My research interests are in large-scale machine learning with a focus on representation learning on graphs.

Earlier, I was an undergraduate student at the Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar, where I worked on problems arising in computational sustainability, large-scale machine learning and processing distributed streaming data.
