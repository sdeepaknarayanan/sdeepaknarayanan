### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Deepak, an MS student at ETH Zurich. 

My research interests are in optimization, machine learning and theoretical computer science with a particular focus on designing efficient algorithms for statistical estimation problems.

Earlier, I was a Research Fellow at Microsoft Research India, working with the ML & AI group on problems related to efficient and scalable graph representation learning and efficient neural learning to rank. Before that, I was an undergraduate student at the Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar, where I worked on problems arising in computational sustainability, large-scale machine learning and processing distributed streaming data.
