### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a graduate student at ETH Zurich. 

My research interests are in high-dimensional statistics, optimization, and theoretical computer science with a particular focus on understanding the computational complexity of statistical inference. I am also interested in robustness in learning (from a theoretical perspective).

Feel free to ping me at dsridharan[AT]ethz.ch if you are interested in discussing or collaborating with me on the above topics.
