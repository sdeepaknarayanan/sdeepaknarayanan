### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Deepak, an MS student at ETH Zurich. 

My research interests are in high-dimensional statistics, optimization, and theoretical computer science with a particular focus on understanding the computational complexity of statistical inference.

Feel free to ping me at dsridharan[AT]ethz.ch if you are interested in collaborating on the above topics.
